Version 2.0 Produced 2014-09-16

The kis.csv files have been included in this folder to enable users to load .csv versions of the kis.xml file entities into their databases for analysis.

The .csv file structure is based on that created for the Unistats output .xml file with some exceptions (see paragraph below). Information for the majority of the .csv entity and field outputs can be found in the 'KIS Unistats output file and check documentation definitions' (http://http://www.hesa.ac.uk/includes/C14061_resources/download/Unistats_checkdoc_definitions.pdf). This documentation includes details of the parent entity, field description, field type, min/max occurrence, field length and additional notes.

Field information for the three .csv lookup tables (ACCREDITATIONTABLE.csv, KISAIM.csv and LOCATION.csv), plus the two additional .csv entities (UCASCOURSEID.csv and SBJ.csv (created to hold the COURSELOCATION UCASCOURSEID and KISCourse SBJ repeating fields)), can be found in the 'Unistats dataset file structure and description' (http://www.hesa.ac.uk/C14061/unistats_dataset_file_structure.html).
